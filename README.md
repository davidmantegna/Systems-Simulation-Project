# Systems-Simulation-Project

A queueing system with a single server providing two stages of service in succession is considered. Every customer receives service in the first stage and in the sequel he decides whether to proceed to the second phase of service or to depart and join a retrial box from where he repeats the demand for a special second stage service after a random amount of time and independently of the other customers in the retrial box. When the server becomes idle, he departs for a single vacation of an arbitrarily distributed length. The arrival process is assumed to be Poisson and all service times are arbitrarily distributed. For such a system the stability conditions and the system state probabilities are investigated both in a transient and in a steady state.
